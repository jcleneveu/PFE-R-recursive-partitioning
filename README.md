# PFE R recursive partitioning

## Why these scripts?
They are part of a project of Big Data in Finance. Their goal is to find the most significant datasets to easily deduce a curve. For instance one can find the bitcoin rate in $USD from multiple parameters such as bitcoin activity, wikipedia views, or google trends.

## How to run?
* Set the working directory
* Edit `config.R` to specify your own data path
* Run ;)

Notes:
* To import party, you need `gcc-fortran` which can be found here: https://gcc.gnu.org/fortran/
* If rstudio tells you something about party being recompiled, feel free to comment this line: `install.packages('party')`

## Dependencies
* `party` => which needs `gcc-fortran` to be compiled
* `R` (of course)
